export const LRC = `[00:11.53]Another day, I wander
[00:13.85]Without escape, I ponder
[00:15.98]A million questions
[00:17.25]I don't need to find an answer for
[00:20.59]Like, is it worth the hassle?
[00:22.78]Or, is it worth the pain?
[00:24.23]Look inside the mirror and say to myself
[00:28.17]Am I enough?
[00:30.81]Oh, am I worth it?
[00:35.570]
[00:37.670]I see the way you notice
[00:39.980]All of my fragile moments
[00:42.210]A part of me is still uncertain I should let you in
[00:46.670]But as it flows and passes
[00:48.800]The time will just confirm
[00:50.150]That when you're here with me
[00:51.940]I can just let go
[00:54.560]Now suddenly, the clouds clear out
[00:59.070]All my worries disappear
[01:01.070]And all the stars, they feel so near
[01:03.340]I could almost reach out right now
[01:07.580]Because of you, feel myself again
[01:11.980]You helped me realize what was here to do
[01:16.480]Because of you, I'm feeling real again
[01:20.840]Now I know where I should go
[01:22.940]You got me walking back to hope
[01:25.090]One step at a time
[01:34.560]I can't explain the feeling
[01:36.630]A sort of, kind of healing
[01:38.980]A different wave of love that travels
[01:41.530]Through your precious words
[01:43.370]At times, I circle back, but
[01:45.600]I guess I just forget
[01:46.980]That when I'm down and low
[01:48.940]I could count on you
[01:51.460]Now suddenly, the clouds clear out
[01:55.760]All my worries disappear
[01:57.810]And all the stars, they feel so near
[02:00.300]I could almost reach out right now
[02:05.530]Because of you, I feel myself again
[02:09.930]You helped me realize what I was here to do
[02:14.370]Because of you, I'm feeling real again
[02:18.520]Now I know where I should go
[02:20.640]You got me walking back to hope
[02:22.250]A step at a time
[02:25.940]â™ª
[02:41.030]What can I say but thank you
[02:43.400]Surrounded by some angels
[02:45.190]Honestly, it's hard for me to live without
[02:49.800]Tomorrow's bringing something new
[02:53.160]I know for certain, it's worth it
[02:56.560]All thanks to you
[03:08.840]Because of you, I feel myself again
[03:13.240]You helped me realize what I was here to do
[03:17.450]Because of you, I'm feeling real again
[03:21.930]Now I know where I should go
[03:23.980]You got me walking back to hope
[03:26.390]Because of you, I feel myself again
[03:30.700]You helped me realize what I was here to do
[03:34.940]Because of you, I'm feeling real again
[03:39.310]Now I know where I should go
[03:41.570]You got me walking back to hope
[03:43.860]One step at a time
[03:51.980]A little closer
[03:55.580]Every step gets closer
